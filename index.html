  <h2>🎈 Happy Birthday! 🎂</h2>
  <p>On your birthday, I just want to take a moment not just to celebrate your special day, but to pour out everything I’ve been carrying in my heart.

First of all, thank you. Thank you for loving me, for choosing me, for being patient with me.
Every single day I feel so lucky to have you in my life. You’ve brought so much light, peace, and meaning to my world. I can’t imagine going through life without your voice, your laugh, your heart  you truly are the most beautiful thing that's ever happened to me.
You’ve taught me what real love is  not the kind from stories or movies, but the kind that holds on, that understands, that forgives, that grows stronger with time.

I know I’m not perfect.
I know there are times I fall short of the man I promised to be for you the man you deserve. And for those times when I hurt you, made you feel alone, or didn’t show up the way I should have... I’m truly sorry.
Please know that it’s never because I don’t care. The truth is, I care more than words can say  sometimes too much, sometimes in messy ways. But I am trying, every day, to be better for you. Because you are worth every effort, every change, every part of me growing.

You’re not just my girlfriend  you’re my home. My reason. My peace. My heart.
And today, on your birthday, I want to celebrate every piece of you: your kindness, your strength, your laugh, your tears, your dreams, your soul.
I hope you feel surrounded by love today not just from me, but from the universe itself. Because the world is better with you in it.

Happy, happy birthday, my love.
I can’t wait to see where life takes us next  and I promise to keep walking with you, holding your hand through all of it.
May this year bring you everything your heart desires and more. You deserve the world. I love you, endlessly.</p>
  <p>Enjoy your special day! 🎁✨</p>
